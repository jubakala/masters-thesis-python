This is extremely simplified Python version of the Java code of my Master's thesis. The point for it was to teach me pandas-usage as well as showcase my current proficiency in Python.

Python packages scipy.stats and pandas need to be installed, in order to run the code.

Application was created with Python 3.7 in Mac OSX environment.

To run the code input:
python app.py
